In today's context, the significance of video and images cannot be overstated, serving essential purposes in both security and recreational domains. They enable users to capture pivotal moments and revisit them at their convenience. However, media quality often suffers due to factors such as unfavorable lighting conditions or incorrect settings, impacting their usefulness. Insufficient surveillance technology can impose significant costs on organizations, including time and resources.

Image and video enhancement techniques are pivotal in addressing these challenges by striving to enhance media quality affected by artifacts like noise, blur, atmospheric disturbances such as haze, and turbulence. The goal is to aid in image and video analysis or simply to produce visually compelling media. However, current methods often rely on assumptions about pixel statistics or visual mechanisms that may not hold true in various real-world scenarios. Moreover, many image enhancement techniques tend to overlook additional factors associated with images.

One prevalent approach for improving low-light images involves leveraging cutting-edge deep learning technology.
